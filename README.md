# Tail Risk Modeling and VaR Estimation

This project models daily tail risk and estimates Value at Risk (VaR) for a two-asset portfolio consisting of:
- 60% S&P 500 (equity)
- 40% TLT (long-term Treasury bonds)

We use a Peaks-Over-Threshold strategy to estimate the distribution of losses of individual assets and copula models to capture the dependence structure between them.
